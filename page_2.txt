7. What are Constraints in SQL?

Constraints are used to specify the rules concerning data in the table. It can be applied for single or multiple fields in an SQL table during the creation of the table or after creating using the ALTER TABLE command. The constraints are:

    NOT NULL - Restricts NULL value from being inserted into a column.
    CHECK - Verifies that all values in a field satisfy a condition.
    DEFAULT - Automatically assigns a default value if no value has been specified for the field.
    UNIQUE - Ensures unique values to be inserted into the field.
    INDEX - Indexes a field providing faster retrieval of records.
    PRIMARY KEY - Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
    FOREIGN KEY - Ensures referential integrity for a record in another table.
