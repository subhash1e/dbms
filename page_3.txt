Adv of dbms :
controling redundancy;restricting unathouraized access; providing persistance storage[Through program object];backup and recovery; storage strucc=ture
multiple user access/interface ; complex relationships among data;
enforcing integrity constraints; 
permitting interfacing and actions using rules;

*just like oop in pl we have obect in dbms
when program terminates values of variable are terminated when program closes in traditional approach --explicitly stored
but in dbms it is saved --persistance storage of objects
___________
efficient execution of queries , like searching since db is stored in disk dbms provide speccial data strucure (indexes) to speed up disk search;
--integrity constraints ex - are dataype a, uinques;;
_______________

deductive interferenceing and actions using rules;;

active database - triggers;;
________________________

disadvanage are: high initial investment in hw sw and training 
overhead of providing security, concurrency control, recovery etec.;
 so for simple applications we need to use file systems
