Adv of dbms :
controling redundancy;
restricting unathouraized access;
providing persistance storage[Through program object];
backup and recovery; 
storage strucc=ture

multiple user access/interface ; complex relationships among data;
enforcing integrity constraints; 
permitting interfacing and actions using rules;

*just like oop in pl we have obect in dbms
when program terminates values of variable are terminated when program closes in traditional approach --explicitly stored
but in dbms it is saved --persistance storage of objects
___________
efficient execution of queries , like searching since db is stored in disk dbms provide speccial data strucure (indexes) to speed up disk search;
--integrity constraints ex - are dataype a, uinques;;
_______________

deductive interferenceing and actions using rules;;

active database - triggers;;
________________________

disadvanage are: high initial investment in hw sw and training 
overhead of providing security, concurrency control, recovery etec.;
 so for simple applications we need to use file systems

 Why not simply use file system??
 ans  - 
 
 actually dbms at the end of the day stores at file.
 dbms ex - oracle,mysql, ibm db
 
 in file system we can create,delete,update file/folders tooo
 
 but dbms along with doing these task it offers many function
 stores extra information
 
 1>Querying in dbms is fast.
 As filesystem search file by file.
 But in dbms data is stored with index
 and extra metadata which query very fast.
