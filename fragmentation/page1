Fragmentation is a process of dividing the whole or full 
database into various subtables or sub relations
-----------------------------------------------------

so that data can be stored in different systems.

The small pieces of sub relations or subtables are called fragments.

These fragments are called logical data units and are stored at various sites**


. It must be made sure that the fragments are such that they can be used to
reconstruct the original relation (i.e, there isn’t any loss of data). 
Just like forking on github.

______________________________________________________
In the fragmentation process,

let’s say,
If a table T is fragmented and is divided 
into a number of fragments say T1, T2, T3….TN.

The fragments contain sufficient information 
to allow the restoration of the original table T. 

This restoration can be done by
the use of UNION or JOIN operation on various fragments. 


This process is called data fragmentation.



All of these fragments are independent which means these fragments can not be derived from others. 



____________________________________________________________________

The users needn’t be logically concerned about
fragmentation which means they
should not concerned that the data is 
fragmented and this is called fragmentation Independence
or we can say fragmentation transparency.

nowadays every big comapny are using fragmentation for their large data
but it doesnt seem any difference while using their webpages/applications
________________________________________
ADVANTAGES of fragmentation are : 

    As the data is stored close to the usage site, the efficiency of the database system will increase//
    
    Local query optimization methods are sufficient for some queries as the data is available locally//
    
    In order to maintain the security and privacy of the database system, fragmentation is advantageous**
    
Disadvantages :

    Access speeds may be very high if data from different fragments are needed//
    If we are using recursive fragmentation, then it will be very expensive//
